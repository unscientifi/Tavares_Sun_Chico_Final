        <h4>Meet Chico</h4>
        <p>Chico is a friendly, playful, and affectionate 2 year old Peka-Tzu Chorkie (Pekingese- Shih-tzu & Yorkie -Chihuahua mix). Chico is 10lbs happy dog who loves to run around chasing his favorite glow-ball or taking a dip in the pool on a hot summer day. Otherwise you will find him sitting on the couch watching TV with his 3 big sisters. He joined our family Dec 10 2011, just in time for Christmas. As soon as we walked into the house, our 3 daughters immediately surrounded our shy, but confident 4 lbs, yet unnamed new addition. After a long 2 minutes the name was obvious to all of us that he would be Chico. From that moment on, he's been part of our family, being cared for, loved and spoiled by everyone. Chico loves to snack on a variety of goodies, from apples, carrots, cucumbers, and ice cream cones. Chico is very proud to share his stories and adventures.</p>

        <h4>About the Author</h4>
         <p>Since she was a child, Jen Dafoe experienced ongoing visits to health care facilities for treatment of a variety of health issues. These multiple visits taught Jen to persevere, to be patient and to try to face the challenges of treatment and operations with optimisim and to become more knowledgeable about her procedures and what impact they might have both on her physicial and emotional well-being. The first in this series "Chico's First Trip to the Dentist", features Chico, a lovable little puppy, and his visit to the dentist. During her own appointments, Jen noticed that many children were experiencing similar anxiety and stress isssues as she was. She decided that a series of easy to read story books for children and their parents on how to reduce stress and fear of upcoming medical procedures would be helpful.</p>
